<p id="anim"><b>Hot Blood horses are called Hot Bloods for two main reasons and neither of these has to do with their blood temperature:
One; they tend to come from the hotter countries like Arabia, Egypt and places like that.
And finally; they are hot bloods! Well, hot heads actually as they tend to be highly strung and hot tempered.
But even with these difficult temperaments people have always been drawn to the faster, wilder, more beautiful and more
enchanting Hot Blood horses rather then their heavy, fuzzy and slow Cold Blood horse cousins.</b>

<!--<div class="pp"><strong>The Ardennais Horse</strong> was originally rather small as far as draught horses go. It was used for not only draught work but for riding as well, unlike many other heavy Cold Blood horses. It is a very docile breed, getting its name from the mountainous home on the French-Belgian border.

<strong>The Arabian horse</strong> is the most ancient and purest breed of horse in the entire world. Its exquisite, unique dished face has made it legendary among horse enthusiast; many rightly consider it to be the most beautiful horse in all creation. Its floating gaits, wide eyes and spirited nature is highly inspirational and makes it easy to see why it has captured the imaginations of so many writers and artists over the centuries.

The origins of this marvellous Hot Blood horse are shrouded in mystery. Ancient artwork suggests that there were horses of an Arabian type that dwelt in the Arabian Peninsula between 2 000-3 000 B.C., but other than this is there is not much evidence to support this date. Either way, their unmatched endurance, sound health and ability to live on small portions of feed definitely shows that they lived in desert-like regions for many, many years.

It comes as a surprise to many people to learn that Arabians have fewer bones than most other breeds; they only have 17 ribs (while most other horses have 18), 5 lumbar vertebrae (compared to 6 in other breeds) and 16 tail vertebrae (instead of 18). These missing bones are essential in determining the unique conformation of the Arabian.

Anyone looking at a <strong>Lusitano horse </strong>for the first time might mistake them for an Andalusian horse. However, these two breeds
of horses are only related to each other, not one and the same. Despite this, the horses bred in the Iberian Peninsula were
regarded as one breed until the early years of the twentieth century when the two countries created their own stud books.
Ever sine the Portuguese created their own stud book; they have greatly improved their breeding program and monitoring of their
horses. They managed to preserve the Lusitanos amazing strength and courage, which made the very best warhorses.

The qualities of courage and strength make the stocky Lusitano an ideal mount for the dangerous and some-what horrible sport
of mounted bullfighting. In Portugal, it is thought a huge disgrace if a horse is injured during a bullfight. To make sure that there
are minimum chances of a horse getting injured, the Lusitanos are thoroughly trained, making sure that they know how to capitalize
on their inborn strengths of acceleration and maneuverability to keep away from the bull.

<strong>The Maremmano horses</strong> are bred in the hills of Tuscany. They are traditional mounts for the butteri, or cattlemen. Maremma
is a coastal tract on the Tyrrhenian Sea that extends from Piombino to Orbetello. It was formerly a marshland that drained a
long time ago, becoming an unhealthy wasteland. Early in the twenty-first century, it was drained again and is now being used
as pastureland.
The Maremmanos origins are shrouded in darkness, but they most likely are descendants of the Neapolitan horses which
were founded on Arabian, Barb and Spanish blood. The Neapolitan horses were made famous in the sixteenth century by Federico
Grisone. Grisone, the founder of the Neapolitan riding academy, was regarded as the first great classical riding master
after the Greek man, Xenophon.

The first few Maremmano horses were pure, but, after a good deal of out-crossing involving English horses like the Norfolk
Roadster, the horses became more a mixture than a pure breed. </p>

With breeding that goes back to Spanish and North African bloodlines, the <strong>Andalusian horse</strong> is not a very fast creature, but has excellent gaits. Andalusians have long, wavy manes and tails and are usually bay, light grey or dappled grey in colour. The heart of the Pure Spanish Horse world is in Andalucia, southern Spain, and ‘Andalusian’ is a term that is generally used to describe a Spanish-type equine.

They also come in an odd greyish purplish colour called mulberry. The Andalusian is a very quiet and reliable equine which has made them very popular throughout the world. In America there is a registry for Andalusians, which includes Spanish/Portuguese crosses or those which can show Spanish or Portuguese blood. In Europe and elsewhere in the world there is no such register and Andalusian is not recognised as a breed.
The Andalusian is a good all-rounder, but are especially good at a special form of dressage called the High School or haute ecole. </p>
