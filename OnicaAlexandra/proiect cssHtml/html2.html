<p id="cold"><b>Cold Blood horses</b> are much heavier and slower than the wild and highly-strung Hot Blood horses. The term ‘Cold Bloods’ is usually used to describe draught (‘draft’ in the USA) horses; that is, large horses that are bred specifically for heavy, tiring labour such as agricultural work. There are a wide variety of magnificent breeds that fit into this category of horses, but they are all similar in their strength and quiet, dependable temperaments.</p>



<!--<div class="pp"><strong>The Ardennais Horse</strong> was originally rather small as far as draught horses go. It was used for not only draught work but for riding as well, unlike many other heavy Cold Blood horses. It is a very docile breed, getting its name from the mountainous home on the French-Belgian border.

<strong>The Norman Cob horse </strong>comes from Normandy, where it is still used for light draught work on small farms in La
Manche, Normandy. Normandy has long been famed for its breeding of horses, especially at the great studs of
Le Pin which was founded as the royal stud in the mid-seventh century). Another great stud of their is
Saint-Lo, where the modern Norman Cob was bred.<br>
The Norman Cob was named after the English Cob. It has a very similar build to the English Cob, but
only became an official breed at the beginning of the twenty-first century. It was only at that time that
the breeds of half-bred horses realized that there was a need to distinguish between horses to be used for
riding, ones for the army and others more suited to light draught work.

The Norman Cob horse was one of the heavier horses more suited for light draught work. It became very
popular as a workhorse (especially in the La Manche region). Even the powerful, majestic Percheron
failed to supplant here.</p>

<strong>The Ardennais Horse</strong> was originally rather small as far as draught horses go. It was used for not only draught work but for riding as well, unlike many other heavy Cold Blood horses. It is a very docile breed, getting its name from the mountainous home on the French-Belgian border.
During the early 1800s Arabian, Thoroughbred, Percheron and Boulonnais blood was introduced to the breed; however these efforts were unsuccessful and eventually abandoned.
The Ardennais was priceless to the military during the Revolution in the reign of the Empire and the hapless Russian campaign due to its stamina and great reserves of energy. It was also one of the breeds of horsethat shared in the horrors of the First World War, as it served as an artillery horse on the battlefields.</p>

<strong>The Breton horse</strong> is stocky and has rather short legs for its lanky height of 15-16.1hh, but despite this it has a lively trot and seems to enjoy being active; these characteristics link back to the Norfolk Roadster blood which was sprinkled in throughout the breed‘s history, as well as infusions of other Cold Blood Horses like the Boulonnais. It is a universally renowned breed and a popular choice for the breeders of draught horses from all over the world when it comes to improving their particular breed through crossbreeding. Strangely enough it is also frequently used for the creation of mules in countries such as India.
<br>
The Breton is yet another European breed which was affected by the Middle Eastern horses like the Arabian which were brought home after the Crusades. Its homeland is Brittany, a province in the northwest of France which they inhabited for many years. No one is entirely certain of how they arrived, but they are believed to be the descendants of the ancient Celtic warriors’ warhorses.</p>

<strong>The Friesian horse </strong>is one of oldest ad most elegant horse breeds of Europe. For centuries it has been used to
influence other breeds such as the Oldenburg of Germany and the Dales and Fell ponies of Great Britain.
The homeland of the Friesian horse is the north of the Netherlands, Friesland. The modern Friesian is supposed
to be descended from an older Cold Blood Horse breed, whose remains have been unearthed in Friesland. The Friesian
has had many breeds influence it, including the blood of Eastern horses from the time of the Crusades and the
Andalusian from the time the Netherlands were under Spanish rule.</p>
