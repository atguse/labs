    <p>Eclipse was maybe the best horse racing in the world. He won 18 races without being defeated. It is said that he was never fully extended. He's remembered in the saying, "Eclipse first and the rest nowhere" to refer to a dominating victory. He was retired from racing because no one could be found to bet against him.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qH-4cVNJAU"><strong>The highest jump</strong></a></p>

   <i>The earliest known direct ancestor of Equus, the eohippus (25 to 50 cm tall),
lived approximately 50 million years ago in both the Old and New Worlds.
Equus originally evolved in North America by the late Pliocene epoch, 
some 4 million years ago, spreading to all continents except Australia.
Horses disappeared from the Americas for unknown reasons about 10,000 
years ago, to be reintroduced by Europeans, c.A.D. 1500.</i><br><br>

<p id="horse" ><b><i> Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring,
 such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits are usually the result of a 
combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods aimed at producing horses for specific tasks. <br>Certain 
breeds are known for certain talents. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardbred"> Standardbreds </a> are known for their speed in harness racing. Some breeds
 have been developed through centuries of crossings with other breeds, while others, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Walking_Horse"> Tennessee Walking Horses </a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_horse"> Morgans </a>, developed from a single sire from which all current breed members descend. There are more than 300 horse breeds 
in the world today.</b><i></p>
