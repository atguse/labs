Warm Blood horses are what you get when you breed a Cold Blood horse to a Hot Blood horse. The result of such a breeding is a strong, fast, agile,
competitive and loyal horse which now make up the majority of the horse breeds in the world. Whoever thought of breeding a Cold Blood horse to a Hot
Blood horse must have been rather clever. Warm Bloods have the same competitive edge as the Hot Blood horses, but without the highly strung and hot-headed drawbacks.

<p id="hot"><b>Hot Blood horses are called Hot Bloods for two main reasons  And neither of these has to do with their blood temperature:
One; they tend to come from the hotter countries like Arabia, Egypt and places like that.
And finally; they are hot bloods! Well, hot heads actually as they tend to be highly strung and hot tempered.
But even with these difficult temperaments people have always been drawn to the faster, wilder, more beautiful and more
enchanting Hot Blood horses rather then their heavy, fuzzy and slow Cold Blood horse cousins.</b>

<!--<div class="pp"><strong>The Ardennais Horse</strong> was originally rather small as far as draught horses go. It was used for not only draught work but for riding as well, unlike many other heavy Cold Blood horses. It is a very docile breed, getting its name from the mountainous home on the French-Belgian border.

The Australian Stock Horse is not an indigenous creature of Australia; it is actually a breed which is descended from the nine original horses which landed in Botany Bay in 1788. Other early imports from South Africa included Arabians, Barbs and Thoroughbreds as well as a breed known as the Cape of Good Hope Horse which was mostly of Andalusian ancestry.

The breeders of this horse were ruthless in their selection. Only the sturdier horses which displayed outstanding stamina were allowed to live; all weaker animals were culled so that the breed would be strong. In addition to more development with Thoroughbred stock, inserts of American Quarter Horse blood were added in the mid-nineteenth century. The Thoroughbreds in particular were popular as there was a steadily growing interest in horseracing among the Australian locals and only the pace of this renowned breed with its unmatched racing pedigree could satisfy this demand.</p>

<br>Not to be confused, the American Bashkir Curly, the Bashkir horse is a Russian breed which originated from the southern foothills of the Ural Mountains. Its name is derived from the Bashkirsky region, where it has been bred by the Bashkiri people for a great many centuries. This collection of people settled in the area near the Volga and Ural Mountains in the seventh century, before the arrival of the warring Mongols.
As it was used as a cavalry mount for the Russian Army in the late 1700s, stud farms were established by the midpoint of the following century. The Bashkirsky region is extremely bleak and inhospitable, having long winters where the temperatures can drop as low as 40 degrees below freezing. Surprisingly, the Bashkir can survive out in the open even in these conditions, and is known to dig through over a metre of snow just to find food.</p> </div>

<strong>The Don horse</strong> was made famous by the Don Cossacks who helped drive out Napoleons invading troops from
Russia between 1812 and 1814. These horses had mixed blood and were descended from the horses of the nomadic
steppe people. The earlier influences of this horse were the Nagai from Mongolia, the Karabakh, the Turkmen
and the Persian Arabian.
In the nineteenth century, infusions of Orlov Trotter and Thoroughbred blood were added and crossings
between the Dons and part-breed Arabian from the Strelets Stud in the Ukraine. All these crossings
which were used to upgrade the original Cossack horse were stopped in the beginning of this century. Since
then, no more outside blood has been used in the creating of the Dons.</p>
