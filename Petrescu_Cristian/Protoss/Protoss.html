                        <br />
                        Their war with the <span class="spanHover" desc="( the Zerg Swarm is a terrifying and ruthless amalgamation of biologically advanced, arthropodal aliens )">zerg</span> has proved otherwise: even the most individually capable warrior cannot overcome such insurmountable numbers.
                        <br />
                        The lesson has been a hard one for the protoss, for their society is built around core philosophies that have been rigidly adhered to for over a thousand years.

                        Nonetheless, the protoss must rely on mobility and surprise to maximize their advantages without getting drawn into a battle of attrition.

                        One of their greatest strengths lies in their fleet, which boasts a variety of ships powerful enough to pound an enemy to atoms.

                    Although the Xel'Naga modus operandi was to let life created develop on its own, one of them broke this rule and chose to uplift this sentient race
                    by blessing it with the Purity of Form.

                        conceded that their latest creation was their first of all their experiments to evolve beyond the feral constraints of baser life-forms,
                        and gave this new species the name of "Protoss"( from Greek ) or "Firstborn" .They directly intervened in the development of the protoss,
                        hoping to create a powerful xel'naga host form they could control.

                        The protoss civilization spread across Aiur within a few millennia and the warring tribes settled under a civilized rule.
                        The tribes were brought even closer together when the Xel'Naga made themselves known to the protoss. Driven to plumb the mysteries of the universe,
                        the overjoyed protoss looked to Amon's Xel'Naga for new truths and insights with reverence and awe.

                        In time, however, they became suspicious of the Xel'Naga regarding their interest in protoss affairs. The protoss began to shy from their creators over the months,
                        with each tribe cultivating wild and unsubstantiated rumors of supposed Xel'Naga treachery. The tribes lost the connection to their primal psychic
                        link as they attempted to completely sever themselves from the rest of their race, dissolving the last remnants of unity and brotherhood among them.
                        As such, the Xel'Naga chose to depart the protoss homeworld but the suspicious protoss attacked their worldships, killing many hundreds of Xel'Naga. However, they were held off
                        while the greater number of worldships were launched. The tribes were left confused and abandoned, turning against each other in despair,
                        yet a number of protoss went with Amon and continued their worship, later becoming the Tal'darim.

                        unthinking hatred towards their brethren, descending into madness as they attacked one another.

                    Khas ("He who brings order"), an individual who studied the forbidden teachings of the xel'naga and unearthed the khaydarin crystals, channeled their primal energies through himself and
                    accessed the primordial, psychic bond of the protoss, becoming the first in millennia to do so, and was flooded by emotions emanating from every protoss.
                    Khas gathered many young protoss together and taught them how to access this bond. They saw that the conflict was folly and believed that the
                    Xel'Naga had been right to abandon them and that they were indeed a failed creation because their racial essence had been corrupted by the rise of ego.

                    However, they maintained that the inner conflict of the protoss and racial turmoil was baseless and hollow because their inherent failure was not of their own doing.
                    Khas developed the Khala religion, calling upon the protoss to forgo their old feuds and reunite. The tribes rallied behind Khas' vision which heralded a bold new age for the protoss.

                <p class="psimple">

                    While the tribes remained intact to remind the protoss of the follies of their past, the Khala called for a shift from tribal society to a caste system
                    so as to remove the last remnants of the old hostilities and strengthen the resolve to embrace a new beginning.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Judicator Caste was comprised of elders and statesmen, with its main responsibility being the governing of the protoss under the dicates of the Khala's Law.
                    The Ara maintained the power within the Judicator Assembly and thus controlled who presided within the ruling Conclave. The Judicator appointed the Shelak to
                    study and protect the khaydarin crystals.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Khalai Caste was the largest, representing the driving industrialists, scientists and workers who continued to rebuild their homelands after the Aeon of Strife.
                    The Furinax Tribe served as weaponsmiths and builders obsessed with merging the sacred energies of the khaydarin crystals with modern technologies.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Templar Caste was comprised of the holy warriors who followed the Khala's disciplines to achieve ever-escalating pinnacles of psionic power.
                    The Akilae were entrusted with protecting Aiur.
                    <br /><br />
                    The protoss built five cities and thirty eight temples across Aiur, and the population swelled to billions. Their growing prosperity led
                    them to rediscover many of the sciences and studies they had lost. Once the protoss had learned space travel, the Auriga were charged with
                    servicing the Great Fleet, which protected the space-ways of Aiur.

                    <br /><br />
                    During this time, the Templar Caste began developing cybernetic warriors with artificial intelligence to augment their ranks.
                    These became known as the Purifiers, but were not treated as equals to their protoss creators. The Purifiers rebelled against their masters,
                    killing many before being subdued. They were put into stasis on the ship Cybros above the moon of Endion, a reminder to researchers on the moon of the dangers of progress.

                    Believing that their individual identities would be erased to further promote the Judicator rule, a few rogue tribes refused to submit to the Khala.
                    Although they were not hostile or militant, they believed that the Conclave's communal agenda would eventually doom the protoss.

                    Adun refused, instead teaching the rogues to hide from the Conclave. Eventually the rogues lost control of their powers, alerting the Conclave.
                    They were secretly banished on a Xel'Naga ship, but still comitted to protect their homeworld.

                        During the Golden Age, two motherships had their khaydarin cores fail, and they fell into a star.
                        Grand Preserver Rohana and her sisters felt this, and sought to prevent such a tragedy from happening again.
                        This resulted in creating the ability for motherships to mass recall and the birth of three arkships that would be a failsafe against protoss society
                        falling to a random chance.
                        <br /><br /> 
                        However, when pondering the question of whether or not to build more, the Grand Preservers discovered they had built the arkships
                        too early, and told the Conclave that they would be thrown away in a last stand if not saved only for a dire need in protoss civilization.
                        The Conclave agreed, and the arkships were sealed away. On each one, one of the Grand Preservers were put into stasis, as well as a cadre of protoss warriors.

                    They also became aware of a xenomorphic threat, the zerg, another alien species also created by the Xel'Naga which began infesting the terrans with their strains.
                    The Conclave, leaded by Judicator Aldaris, dispatched Tassadar and a force of protoss to destroy the infestation by purifying the infested worlds.

                    Tassadar's force failed in its mission, and the remnants traveled to the new zerg homeworld, Char.
                    There, Tassadar struck an alliance with the Dark Templar prelate Zeratul, against Aldaris' orders, and discovered a weakness in the zerg command structure which could be exploited only by the Dark Templar.

                    But this information had come to a great cost, for the zerg <span class="spanHover" desc="( it was a millennia-old brain-like entity created to bring order to the zerg and guide them into merging with the protoss )">Overmind</span> had a psi-link with Zeratul and saw the location of the protoss homeworld.

                    The Overmind quickly launched his assault on the protoss homeworld, sending the majority of the zerg force away from Char and eventually embedded itself onto the planet's crust.
                    The protoss were losing the battle. Brave heroes such as Fenix fell to the Swarm while defending Aiur's cities and when Tassadar brought Zeratul to Aiur, a protoss civil war

                    The protoss attempted a revenge strike on Kerrigan, the self-proclaimed Queen of Blades, because she used the Dark Templar Matriarch, Raszagal, to control them and kill Judicator Aldaris. The strike failed
                    and Zeratul was forced to release the Matriarch by killing her. This amazed Kerrigan and granted Zeratul a chance to escape.

                        The Khalai struggled to recover from the loss of Aiur while attempting to reunify their society with the Dark Templar.
                        It was a difficult transition for both sides, and the name Raszagal was invoked more than once to keep the peace.
                        The Hierarchy was established to govern this new unified protoss, but division nearly caused its collapse.

                    <li>
                        Extending back from the crown of the head, protoss have a bony crest. Beneath it, emerging from the back of the head, are the nerve cords, allowing them to access their

                    <li>
                        Protoss sleep and dream in a manner similar to humans. When particularly emotional, streams of energy have been observed to stream from a protoss's eyes,

                        Eye colors include blue, green, gold, and red. The proliferation of eye color corresponds to kindred;
                        Khalai eyes are predominantly blue, Nerazim are predominantly green, and red is present among the Tal'darim;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A protoss's maximum life expentancy is 1000 years but they are not a prolific people;
                        The population of Aiur, however, had reached billions. Before the Fall of Aiur, the protoss population was in decline due to systematic extermination;
                        the protoss were passing away from sheer age. Their numbers have been further reduced through conflict, and their population continues to decline;
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        They possess three hearts and protoss blood is blue or purple and coloration is considered a sign of ethnicity, with each protoss tribe having a specific subtly
                        differing hue or typical pattern of markings associated with it;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As with terrans and zerg, protoss genetic material consists of DNA with helix strands. Protoss DNA is "antithetical" to zerg DNA and cannot be combined through
                        infestation under normal circumstances. Artificial methods can be used to generate hybrids however;

                    On the battlefield protoss warriors are known to fight with tremendous power and grace, but despite the chaos they inflict on their enemies they are
                    capable of being mortally wounded.
                    <br /><br />
                    When a protoss nears death, their foes often bear witness to a startling flash of bright light as the protoss warrior seemingly disappears.

                    Primitive races are known to quail in superstitious fear upon seeing this, but it is actually another aspect of protoss technology at work rather than any sort of supernatural feat.
                    <br /><br />
                    Protoss armor is typically equipped with a complex teleportation mechanism that can detect when its wearer is grievously injured and automatically teleports the warrior
                    to the nearest safe haven. This of course is dependent on the mechanism being fully functional, as there is the risk of being damaged during combat.

                    Those protoss who are too badly injured after the battle but still wish to continue fighting are placed within the shell of a dragoon or immortal, which allows them to
                    serve their brethren on the battlefield. The choice is left to each individual protoss; whether to continue service or join with their ancestors in the Khala.
                    <br />
                    Protoss that suffer injuries to their psionic appendages (such as the Nerazim) attach clamps to the remnants in order to prevent energy bleed.
                    <br /><br />
                    Terran understanding of protoss physiology is limited. Their respective biologies are similar enough for
                    substances and drugs, such as Sundrop and a medic's medicine to affect both.

                <h2 class="pheader">Mental Abilities</h2>

                <p class="psimple">

                    Protoss are extraordinarily focused, to a degree unmatched by humans and have been described as "devastatingly intelligent", but their thought processes work very differently than those of terrans.
                    <br />
                    Protoss are natural mind-readers. Protoss must learn to filter the thoughts they read and filter (or block) the thoughts that they release (which would prevent other protoss from reading their minds).
                    <br />
                    The ability to block thoughts is compromised by the Khala, which prevents the protoss which follow that philosophy from hiding from each other.
                    During the Aeon of Strife, Protoss regularly used their mind-screening abilities to ambush each other.
                    <br /><br />
                    Protoss can use their psionic abilities to shield themselves, charge their tools and weapons, and to make, manipulate or meld matter.
                    <br />
                    They can sometimes access memories and strands of experience from protoss who have died, but only preservers have full access to this knowledge.
                    Protoss warriors can learn from the spirits of fallen warriors at the Templar Archives.

                <h2 class="pheader">Communication</h2>

                <p class="psimple">

                    Protoss can communicate telepathically with each other through "speaking", a method that transmits little or no emotional content.
                    Using their nerve cords they can also communicate in a manner which enables them to sense each others' emotions, a key part of their psionic gestalt, the Khala.
                    Protoss who follow the Khala use both methods of communication. Dark Templar ritually sever their nerve cords, which prevents the emotional link.
                    <br /><br />
                    Protoss can create a special kind of mind-meld deep within the Khala, where no one can lie.
                    Protoss performing this kind of mind-meld hold up their hands and face their palms to each other; both palms softly glow.
                    This kind of communication was also possibly held between Executor Adun and Raszagal, the latter not following the Khala.
                    <br /><br />
                    Protoss "speak" a language called Khalani, communicating through telepathic bursts.
                    The privacy of the conversation is up to those involved on it. Even through communication, pain can be caused via this telepathy via mental spikes.
                    Terrans exposed to protoss communication often hear nearly meaningless sounds.
                    However, at least some protoss have the ability to "translate" the thoughts into a form which a terran can understand.
                    <br /><br />
                    The protoss of the Aeon of Strife did not understand the concept of non-psionic communication. Khas effectively (re-)created the concept of reading and writing, a necessity for translating some xel'naga relics.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to telepathy, protoss possess a degree of body language used in conveying feelings, intent, etc.
                    <br />
                    For instance, a bob of the head and movement of a protoss' nerve chords is a sign of contempt.
                    <br />
                    Bowing of the head, shaking and/or mottling of the skin is a sign of emotional distress.

                <h2 class="pheader">Society</h2>

                <p class="psimple">

                    Protoss culture is built around core philosophies that have been rigidly adhered to for over a millennium.
                    As such, it is difficult for their society to adapt to changing circumstances. The integration of Khalai and Nerazim is a case in point in different cultural values.
                    <br /><br />
                    Khalai culture has its roots in the Aeon of Strife, the period of chaos following the retreat of the xel'naga.
                    At the end of the Strife, the protoss were reunited under the precepts of the Khala ("Path to Ascension") as promoted by the mystic Khas.
                    The Khala took advantage of the natural psionic communal link and established a caste system. Protoss can be fanatical when it comes to their religious beliefs.
                    <br /><br />
                    Not all protoss embraced the Khala. Many outcasts, eventually known as the Nerazim, were later banished from Aiur.
                    Yet other outcasts, the Tal'darim, use drugs to cut themselves off from the Khala.
                    <br /><br />
                    Female protoss rarely attain positions of power, except among the Nerazim. They are rare among the Templar Caste and were never part of the Conclave.
                    <br />
                    Many protoss have a prejudice against female terrans, as the only one they've had much contact with was Kerrigan (contrasted to Jim Raynor).
                    Very young protoss are referred to as "younglings."
                    <br /><br />
                    The protoss are considered a "warrior race", although they were not constantly at war.
                    They trained incessantly for combat, however, and prior to the Great War warred with the kalathi and "other types" of protoss.
                    <br /><br />
                    Protoss have a strict code of justice and honor, and strongly believe in their responsibility to enforce it.
                    They strive for glory in battle. Protoss have always been willing to sacrifice their lives for other members of their species.
                    <br /><br />
                    Aiur holds great, almost spiritual significance to all protoss.

                <h2 class="pheader">Language and religion</h2>

                <p class="psimple">

                    Protoss have a mental language, Khalani, and a written language, which the Nerazim maintained.
                    <br />
                    Khalai can communicate wordlessly due to the properties of the Khala, while Nerazim must voice their words vocally.

                <p class="psimple">

                    A number of protoss are highly regarded by both Khalai and Nerazim, and have become associated with honorifics (e.g. "en taro"—"in honor of"):

                </p>
                <ul class="psimple">
                    <li class="li1">
                        Khas – <br /><br />
                        A prominent figure in protoss society, he was the charismatic and spiritual leader who brought an end to the Aeon of Strife by using ancient xel'naga artifacts,
                        the khaydarin crystals, to unite the warring tribes by calling them into a communal telepathic matrix. The belief that this was necessary for the protoss to survive
                        became known as the Khala, and is followed by almost all protoss factions. The Path of Khala is the sole and dominant religion in the society of the protoss of Aiur,
                        and societal rank (for example, Templar, Judicator) and honor are linked with Khala.

                    <li class="li1">
                        Adun – <br /><br />
                        Another well known figure in protoss culture, he is honored by Khalai and Dark Templar alike. A powerful warrior in his time, he was charged with the
                        extermination of the rogue tribes by the Conclave. Unable to bring themselves to slaughter their kin, Adun and his troops attempted to hide the heretics.
                        Though he failed, he would be known as a savior to the Dark Templar, and would gain similar status on Aiur after the myth of the heretics spread, revealing
                        that he "saved" Aiur from the heretics and their "anarchist" ways. The phrase "En Taro Adun" is used by the protoss as a formal greeting or farewell, and
                        also serves as a battlecry, while the Dark Templar use "Adun Toridas" in a similar fashion.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li1">
                        Tassadar – <br /><br />
                        He led the Koprulu Expeditionary Force during the Great War. The subsequent reunification of the Khalai with the Dark Templar began with his
                        befriending of Zeratul. This alliance allowed the protoss to slay cerebrates and the first Overmind. Tassadar sacrificed himself to kill the Overmind.
                        For his heroic example, he serves as a contemporary example of protoss virtues. Some Templar, notably Artanis, Selendis and Zeratul have taken to saying "En Taro Tassadar".
                    </li>
                    <li class="li1">

                        Zeratul – <br /><br />
                        A hero of the Great War, Zeratul taught Tassadar how to channel void energies, allowing him to defeat the Overmind.
                        Though exiled for slaying Raszagal and leading the zerg to Aiur, Zeratul's tireless devotion to discovering the meaning behind the hybrid and
                        Amon gave the protoss the edge they needed in the End War. Through the conflict, Artanis took to saying "En Taro Zeratul," and in the aftermath of the
                        conflict attributed their victory to Zeratul.
                    </li>
                    <li class="li1">
                        Artanis – <br /><br />
                        After serving in the Great War and Brood War, Artanis took over the role of Hierarch of the Daelaam. When Amon returned and corrupted the Khala,
                        he gathered what few loyal protoss remained, and struck back, bringing the ancient Purifiers and Tal'darim into the Daelaam's fleet. Artanis reclaimed Aiur,
                        and thrust Amon back into the Void, then sending the fleet in to finally strike him down forever. "En Taro Artanis" was shouted as an honorific in the Daelaam's
                        last stand against Amon on Aiur.

                    The extent to which the protoss have been a unified people has waxed and waned over time.
                    <br /><br />
                    Originally tribal based, the protoss settled under centralized rule with the coming of the xel'naga, only to revert back to tribalism in the Aeon of Strife,
                    only to once again be unified after thousands of years.
                    <br />
                    Under the Khala, the Khalai formed the caste-based Protoss Empire while those who refused to submit became the outcast Nerazim.
                    <br /><br />
                    In the aftermath of the Brood War, both lines of protoss were united under the Daelaam. However, internal tension once again led to tribalism and their civilization fractured.
                    <br />
                    In the aftermath of the End War, the Daelaam united the remaining tribes, and reclaimed Aiur as the homeland for all protoss.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Tal'darim are a branch of protoss that were taken from Aiur during the departure of the xel'naga, and serve as a seperate culture from the Khalai and the Nerazim,
                    unconnected to the Khala. They are warlike, and before his fall served Amon with a fanatical devotion, using terrazine to become closer to him.
                    <br /><br />
                    While not true protoss, the Purifiers were templar designed by the protoss who rebelled over not being treated as true templar.
                    <br />
                    During the End War, they were absorbed back into protoss society with the promise of equal treatment to true protoss.

                        Protoss technology is a blend of psionics and mundane technology and has shown itself to be far more advanced than many other species of the galaxy,
                        including humanity.
                        <br /><br />
                        Some protoss technology requires vespene gas as a catalyst.
                        <br />
                        Protoss utilize cybernetic technology to save lives, and bolster their warriors' prowess.
                        <br />
                        Battlefield communications between protoss are efficient. The use of energy for defensive purposes is a standard protoss practice.
                        <br /><br />
                        Protoss armor contains teleportation technology which whisks the warrior away to safety when they are injured to the point of death.
                        Injured and crippled protoss can be transformed into cybernetic warriors.
                        <br /><br />
                        Due to their low population, the protoss frequently use robots in their military.
                        Due to their diminished population, the protoss are in a position of not being able to waste resources.
                        <br /><br />
                        Protoss pilots are an integral part of their ship, and using it drains their energies.
                        Protoss aerospace craft utilize anti-gravity technology to keep them airborne when operating within a planet's atmosphere.
                        <br /><br />
                        The protoss developed powerful crystal technology and incredibly powerful weapons of war, such as the colossus and the mothership,
                        and could develop more powerful technology if they wished.
                        <br />
                        The protoss limit their use of technology, as they are frightened of what they could do with it
                        and feel they have perfected a slow but steady and methodical system of technological development.
                        The longevity of protoss history has allowed them to develop incredible weapons of war over the course of it.
                        <br /><br />
                        Despite the Fall of Aiur, the protoss can still produce starships on other planets, and they have also inventories of them in many places.

                        "Protos" in Greek means "first". This name is supposedly given because the protoss were the first semi-successful xel'naga creation.
                        The protoss were later deemed a failure by the greater species, leading to the engineering of the zerg.

                    <li>
                        In StarCraft online culture, the protoss are often referred to simply as Toss (or P or Pro or PTo by some Korean players);
                        amongst more experienced players, it's usually abbreviated to simply P.
                    </li>
                    <li>The protoss bear similarities in their "look and feel" with the draenei of Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft universe.</li>
                    <li>
                        All protoss names undergo careful consideration, as Blizzard has very strict guidelines as to how a protoss name should and should not look like.
                        This is linked to a real-world dictionary of Khalani being maintained.

                        While the terrans and zerg had different backstories in the first pitch for StarCraft, the protoss appear to be much like their counterparts from the end-game.
                        In this version they were more willing to take direct action against terrans however, as demonstrated by the original Tau Ceti backstory.
                    </li>
                    <li>How the protoss think and feel were mostly taken from Christie Golden's take on them in The Dark Templar Saga.</li>
                    <li>
                        For StarCraft II, the protoss underwent an asthetics redesign, with more flowing shapes, less geometric angles and a more organic feel.
                        <br />
                        This was part of an unofficial retcon on Blizzard's part, an idea that protoss structures in StarCraft II had always looked the way they appeared in the game.
                        <br />
                        Early styles bore resemblance to that of the blood elves of Warcraft due to their flashy engravings, but this art style was abandoned.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A challenge for writing protoss is that they do not possess the same kind or amount of body language as humans. <br />
                        The writers of Legacy of the Void watched episodes of ER, for as it per its nature as a medical drama, the characters' faces are often covered bar their eyes. <br />
                        Eye movement was studied in regards to how it could apply to protoss characters, as their eyes are their main conveyers of emotion. <br />
                        While the protoss are intended to be "unkowable" (in regards to humans/terrans), it was also intended that elements of humanity still shine through.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Blizzard refers to the protoss as their "space samurai," or "space paladins." In Blizzard's mind, the protoss are defined by the following traits:
